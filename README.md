## React & Firebase - Auth & Crud
### Auth by email & socials (read socials folder readme to setup) 
### formik & YUP are used form state management, validation & submission 
### The Auth Components are ready to re-use with any auth API, simply change the API endpoints (signup, signin & signout functions, etc).

#### Crud is still incomplete, might complete it later. (firebase is very diff than a normal API => components won't be reusable)
